## CV 
My updated CV is made available here: [Elzinga_CV.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12yKEt54_Kd5CGv5tDpJE2tDoz9VQ_Tu5/view?usp=sharing)

## Background
I grew up near Lansing, MI where I attended Lansing Community College for one year. I completed my undergraduate degree at Wichita State University in 2018. I now study at the University of Tennessee where I am advised by Dr. Christopher Strickland and part of the Strickland Lab. My research projects are usually combines approaches from mathematics, statistics, to address fundamental scientific questions based in ecology, evolution, agriscience, epizoology, etc. I earned my MS in Mathematics in Dec. 2020. I am projected to earn my PhD in Mathematics with a concentration in mathematical ecology & evolution and a MS in Statistics in 2023. 

## Current work
I currently split my professional time working on my dissertation, teaching undergraduate mathematics courses, mentoring undergraduate researchers, and taking courses for my programs. My dissertation is currently targeted in three areas. 
- Understanding how shortcomings in contributions to highly connected ecological communities affects population dynamics, using social bees and pesticides as a case study. 
- Investigating the cultural evolution of bird song through dispersion, disruption, and selection.
- Connecting ecological niche models to mechanistic models of populations.

## Personal 
My research interests are largely reflected through my hobbies. I enjoy birding (finding and identifying birds in their natural habitats) and strategic board games. I also enjoy cooking ethnic foods and hiking. I am married to my beautiful wife who is a middle school science teacher and I have one cat named Checkers.
