Welcome to my professional website. I'm a PhD student at the University of Tennessee working in the intersection of Mathematics, Statistics, and Science. While the majority of my work could be classified as biomathematics and/or biostatistics, I'm actively working in a number of fields and am open to projects in new domains. In Dec. 2020 I earned my MS in Mathematics. I am projected to earn my PhD in Mathematics with a concentration in mathematical ecology & evolution and a MS in Statistics in May 2023. Here you will find my research projects, talks, publications, teaching information, contact information, and more! I'm constantly seeking opportunities (research projects, employment, professional development, mentoring, etc.) that are remotely tied to my interests, so feel free to contact me if you have any questions about my work or have potential opportunities.
