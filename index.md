Welcome to my professional website. I'm a PhD student at the University of Tennessee working in the intersection of Mathematics, Statistics, and Science. In Dec. 2020 I earned my MS in Mathematics. I am projected to earn my PhD in Mathematics with a concentration in mathematical ecology and evolution and as well as a MS in Statistics in May 2023.  Here you will find my research projects, talks, publications, teaching information, contact information, and more!
