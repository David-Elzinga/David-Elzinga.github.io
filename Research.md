## Topics of interest
Broadly speaking, I am interested in data-driven and computational approaches that often are complemented by analytical approaches to address hypotheses and questions that are scientific, mathematic, and/or statistical in nature. I enjoy collaborating as part of a research team, working hands-on with empirical scientists, and sharing results with policy-makers. I also enjoy mentoring undergraduate research, along with collaborating with other graduate students. 

## Current work
I'm actively working on my dissertation and mentoring undergraduate research. My dissertation is currently targeted in three areas. 
- Understanding how shortcomings in contributions to highly connected ecological communities affects population dynamics, using social bees and pesticides as a case study. 
- Investigating the cultural evolution of bird song through dispersion, disruption, and selection.
- Connecting ecological niche models to mechanistic models of populations.
I'm also currently mentoring one undergraduate student who is creating a mathematical model of the winter-tick epizootic of moose.
